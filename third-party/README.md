This directory contains an alternate source for the Litten notation, something called the Village Music Project:

and

> Transcribed into ABC by Anne Wride for the Village Music Project, from Gale Huntington's transcription 
...
> This is my Village Music Project annex section, containing all the VMP  transcriptions, including new and newly revised ABC files, many of which have yet to appear on the VMP website.  

That site has no proper open source license, but it does have something roughly equivalent - the following text:

> I would encourage you to download, and even share, the collections whole as ABC, they take up hardly any room. The files are human-readable even without the aid of software. This will ensure their survival far into the future even better than PDF would. These transcriptions are the result of many years' work by a team of volunteers. If you make use of them in any form of publication or recording, please remember to credit us appropriately. The list of volunteers is HERE

The list of volunteers is at:
http://www.cpartington.plus.com/Links/A%20Number%20of%20Supporting%20Items/ABCTranscribers.html

And that list includes the following line:
> Anne Wride

In this directory I am mirroring the ABC and PDF found on the above site, to prevent it from being lost in the future, and to enable making further use of it in this open source project. The terms of the license are to provide attribution, which I will take care to do.
