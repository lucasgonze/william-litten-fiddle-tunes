<q>Litten MS.abc</q> was transcribed into ABC by Anne Wride for the Village Music Project, from Gale Huntington's transcription. It was downloaded from http://www.cpartington.plus.com/Links/Litten/Litten%20Info.html. 

<q>William Litten's Fiddle Tunes: 1800-1802</q> was authored by Gale Huntington and published by Hines Point Publishers.

The underlying source material - William Litten's hand-written notebook, now in the possession of Dukes County Historical Society in Edgartown, Massachusetts - is in the public domain. 

What is copyrightable in Anne Wride's work, Gale Huntington's, and my own, is limited. The US Copyright Office puts it this way:

> Works are original when they are independently created by a human author and have a minimal degree of creativity. Independent creation simply means that you create it yourself, without copying. The Supreme Court has said that, to be creative, a work must have a “spark” and “modicum” of creativity. There are some things, however, that are not creative, like: titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; and mere listings of ingredients or contents. And always keep in mind that copyright protects expression, and never ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, or discoveries.
