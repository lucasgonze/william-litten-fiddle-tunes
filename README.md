# William Litten's Fiddle Tunes 1800-1802

This is a project to digitize the music in an out-of-print book titled "William Litten's Fiddle Tunes: 1800-1802." The book was published in 1977 in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, by Hines Point Publishers. As far as I can tell the original had only a single run. It was probably self-publishing. I came across it in a bookstore in Boston ("Ave. Victor Hugo") around 1982. 

In the forty-ish years since since then I have returned to the book again and again, and my copy has become badly worn. The cover is falling off. The binding won't last much longer. Yet there seems to be no alternative to my dog-eared copy. It's out of print, so I can't buy a new one. There appear to be no digitized scans, though several academic libraries appear to have listings of hard copy versions. 

In addition to my personal need to have a replacement for the book, letting it disappear seems wrong to me. This knowledge and these sounds shouldn't be lost. Huntington's publication of Litten's hand-written original kept it alive for me. I hope this digital version here will keep it alive for other musicians and music historians. 

In addition I hope to make improvements:

- Improve readability with digital typesetting
- Allow players to hear audio previews
- Enabling ongoing improvements such as the addition of chord changes
- Allow printouts with one tune per page
- Digital-native reading such as ebooks and PDF compilations

# Copyright Status

 Although I am confident my transcription and distribution of this work would pass a fair use challenge, it would be good to simply put the entire book under a permissive license. In hopes of convincing the rights holder to do that I attempted to find them. These are the facts that I discovered. 

1. The original publication was in 1977 in the state of Massachusetts. 

2. The author, Elon Gale Huntington, died in 1993 in Massachusetts. [Obituary](https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/elon-gale-huntington-24-2sf9dg).

3. Rights probably passed to the author's wife, Mildred Tilton Huntington. She died in 2003 in Massachusetts. [Record on Find-a-Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/185317603/mildred-aurelia-huntington).

4. Rights probably passed to the author's child, Emily Huntington Rose. She died in 2013 in Massachusetts. [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/192476433/emily-rose](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/192476433/emily-rose)

5. Rights would have passed to author's grandchildren, but I found no record of Emily Huntington Rose having children. 

6. Rights could conceivably has passed to siblings of Mildred Tilton Huntington, but there were none.
